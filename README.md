# Text Editor
This is a simple *prototype* of text editor created using HTML and Javascript. It takes textarea and converts it into 
nice looking (soon) editor.

It is not totally functional and it has many bugs. Also, when it gets into some sort of working stable status, it will require
re-factoring.

## Running
Please download all the files and run test.html. There is an *init()* method called on *textEditor* object that initialises
the editor.

### TODO
* example needs nice html layout;
* when cursor goes out of container area needs to be scrolled;
* browser storage;
* api for things like validation, syntax highlighting, importing and exporting;
* template system.
